## Note

There are some temporay data created which are used by other figures as well.
Therefore figure S1 have to be run first, and the remaining figures should assembled in order.

## Description

### Figure S1. Shows neuronal compartment of the example neurons 

### Figure 1. Experiment overview (made with )

### Figure 2. Segmentation of axon based on neighboring negative peaks
 
### Figure 3. Distribution of standard deviation of random samples

### Figure 4. Segmentation of dendrite based on neighboring positive peaks

### Figure 5. Voltage peaks in axons and dendrites

### figure 6. Structual connectivity

### figure 7. Functional connectivity

### figure 8. Polychronous groups

### figure 9. Network structural connectivity and parameter dependency.

### figure 10. Network functional connectivity and parameter dependency.

### figure 11. Parameter search to match network structural and functional connectivity.


## Not yet done.

### figure 12. Compare delays.

### figure 13. Statistics about polychronous groups (or add to figure 8?)
